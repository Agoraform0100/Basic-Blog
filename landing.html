<h2> Meat is the cornerstone of any great meal, here are some examples: </h2>

<div class="meats">
<p> Pork Loin melts in the mouth, provided it is properly prepared, fresh, and served with a slice of lime. </p>
</div>
<div class = "meats">
<p> Lamb is quite delicious as well, often consisting of more tender meat that is best served after marinating for 24 hours prior to cooking. A quality lamb dish is often served in strips with mushrooms, cream of spinach, and a fine white wine. </p>
